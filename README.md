# Keep-Awake
KeepAwake.exe works by activating and deactivating the scroll lock key at 60 second intervals.
To run KeepAwake.exe, place it somewhere on your system, and double click the application.
A command window will briefly appear and disappear, and a clover-shaped icon will appear in the windows sytem tray (bottom right corner of the screen).
 
The process will start automatically, and can be controlled by right-clicking on the icon. 
 
Start – begin the process to keep the system awake
Stop – stop the process to keep the system awake
Exit – kill the process tree, and the icon will disappear
This runs in user-space, and does not require admin rights or installation.
